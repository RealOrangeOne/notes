# Colophon

This site is built with [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [`mkdocs-material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Sure, it's designed for docs, but with a few modifications (like the [`tags`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/tags/) plugin) it can be used for notes. I made some fairly large modifications to how tags work, so the sidebar is structured by tag rather than by directory (directories are fairly arbitrary, and might get removed entirely in future).

It's been through a few iterations in the past, starting with [`gatsby-theme-code-notes`](https://github.com/mrmartineau/gatsby-theme-code-notes/), on to [`hugo-theme-notes`](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/hugo-theme-notes/), and finally here.

The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/notes/), and deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://realorangeone.github.io/notes/).
