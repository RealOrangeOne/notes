# Colophon

This site is built with [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [`mkdocs-material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Sure, it's designed for docs, but with a few modifications (like the [`tags`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/tags/) plugin) it can be used for notes.

It's been through a few iterations in the past, starting with [`gatsby-theme-code-notes`](https://github.com/mrmartineau/gatsby-theme-code-notes/), on to [`hugo-theme-notes`](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/hugo-theme-notes/), and finally here.

The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/notes/), and deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://realorangeone.github.io/notes/).
